<h1>Biography</h1>
</div>
<p>I am now a Research Fellow of  <a href="https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/Research1/AI_IoT.htm">AIoT Group</a>, leading by <a href="https://yunxinliu.github.io/">Yunxin Liu</a>, at Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University, China. 
<br><br>
My research interests include deep learning system and algorithm design, Hardware/Software co-design. 
Currently I am focusing on efficient large language models serving on edge and empowering traditional systems, such as video analytics, by large generative models.
<br><br>
I received my dual PhDs respectively from University of Göttingen, Germany, co-advised by <a href="https://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~fu/">Xiaoming Fu</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=5SVQD3oAAAAJ&hl=de">Marcus Baum</a>, and Nanjing University, China, co-advised by <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen/">Guihai Chen</a> and <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/daihp/">Haipeng Dai</a>.
